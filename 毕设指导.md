- Towards Automated Reentrancy Detection for Smart Contracts Based on Sequential Models
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8970384
In the last decade, smart contract security issues lead to tremendous losses, which has attracted increasing public attention both in industry and in academia. Researchers have embarked on efforts with logic rules, symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in smart contract vulnerability detection tasks. However, the existing detection tools are far from satisfactory（现有检测工具效果不佳）. In this paper, we attempt to utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional long-short term memory with attention mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we **propose contract snippet representations for smart contracts**, which contributes to capturing essential semantic information and control flow dependencies. Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart contracts show that our proposed model and contract snippet representations significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. In addition, this work proves that it is practical to apply deep learning-based technology on smart contract vulnerability detection, which is able to promote future research towards this area.

- A new scheme of vulnerability analysis in smart contract with machine 
The smart contracts deployed in Ethereum carry huge amounts of virtual coins. However, there are vulnerabilities in some of these smart contracts, which makes them vulnerable to malicious attacks. Due to the characteristics of blockchain, such vulnerable contracts are difficult to be revoked. In order to prevent vulnerable contracts, it is very important to detect the **loopholes** in these contracts before their deployment. In this paper, we focus on three vulnerabilities of smart contract: has_short_address, has_flows and is_greedy. For the three kinds of vulnerabilities, we propose **slicing matrix**, a new method to extract vulnerability feature, and construct three vulnerability detection models for comparison. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy based on neural network and slice matrix is better than that based on neural network and opcode features. In other words, slice matrix can improve the accuracy of vulnerable contract detection. Among our three detection models, the model based on random forest and opcode features performs best.

- Attention-based Machine Learning Model for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection
Ethereum attracts extensive attention due to its distinctive function of smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). Since the number of contracts on blockchain has increased vigorously, various security vulnerabilities come up. Researchers rely on static symbolic analysis method at first, and it seems to perform well in the accuracy of vulnerability detection. However, this method **requires manual analysis in advance and it needs to traverse all the possible execution paths to find out the vulnerable ones. The deeper the path goes, the more time it costs to detect the contracts**(传统技术需要进一步的人工分析，还有路径爆炸的问题). This paper proposes an approach to detect smart contracts vulnerability on blockchain by using machine learning(ML) methods. This approach aims to build **a general benchmark** for new vulnerability detection in order to reduce the demand of expert manpower. Moreover, the high-speed-performance ML algorithm makes quick detection comes true. As long as we adjust the threshold of the model, it can work as a fast prefilter for the traditional symbolic analysis tools in further improvement of accuracy.

- Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection: From Pure Neural Network to Interpretable Graph Feature and Expert Pattern Fusion (不愧是你，这篇好难)
https://github.com/Messi-Q/AMEVulDetector
Smart contracts hold digital coins worth billions of dollars, their security issues have drawn extensive attention in the past years. Towards smart contract vulnerability detection, conventional methods heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low accuracy and poor scalability(传统方法依赖expert rules，导致准确率和可扩展性差的问题). Recent deep learning approaches alleviate this issue but fail to encode useful expert knowledge（而深度学习方法没有有效利用expert rule）. In this paper, we explore combining deep learning with expert patterns in an explainable fashion. Specifically, we develop automatic tools to extract expert patterns from the source code. We then cast the code into a semantic graph to extract deep graph features. Thereafter, the global graph feature and local expert patterns are fused to cooperate and approach the final prediction, while yielding their interpretable weights. Experiments are conducted on all available smart contracts with source code in two platforms, Ethereum and VNT Chain. Empirically, our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released.

- ESCORT: Ethereum Smart COntRacTs Vulnerability Detection using Deep Neural Network and Transfer Learning
Ethereum smart contracts are automated decentralized applications on the blockchain that describe the terms of the agreement between buyers and sellers, reducing the need for trusted intermediaries and arbitration. However, the deployment of smart contracts introduces new attack vectors into the cryptocurrency systems. In particular, programming flaws in smart contracts can be and have already been exploited to gain enormous financial profits. It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to detect vulnerabilities of different classes in contracts in an efficient manner. Existing machine learning-based vulnerability detection methods are limited and only inspect whether the smart contract is vulnerable, or train individual classifiers for each specific vulnerability, or demonstrate multi-class vulnerability detection without extensibility consideration. To overcome the scalability and generalization limitations of existing works, we propose ESCORT, the first Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based vulnerability detection framework for Ethereum smart contracts that support lightweight transfer learning on unseen security vulnerabilities, thus is extensible and generalizable. ESCORT leverages a multi-output NN architecture that consists of two parts: (i) A common feature extractor that learns the semantics of the input contract; (ii) Multiple branch structures where each branch learns a specific vulnerability type based on features obtained from the feature extractor. Experimental results show that ESCORT achieves an average F1-score of 95% on six vulnerability types and the detection time is 0.02 seconds per contract. When extended to new vulnerability types, ESCORT yields an average F1-score of 93%. To the best of our knowledge, ESCORT is the first framework that enables transfer learning on new vulnerability types with minimal modification of the DNN model architecture and re-training overhead.

- **Hunting the Ethereum Smart Contract: Color-inspired Inspection of Potential Attacks**(这个可以一试)
Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are gaining unprecedented popularity and understanding. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert's labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting compiler bugs of Ethereum smart contract.
