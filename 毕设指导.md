https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8970384
In the last decade, smart contract security issues lead to tremendous losses, which has attracted increasing public attention both in industry and in academia. Researchers have embarked on efforts with logic rules, symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in smart contract vulnerability detection tasks. However, the existing detection tools are far from satisfactory（现有检测工具效果不佳）. In this paper, we attempt to utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional long-short term memory with attention mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we **propose contract snippet representations for smart contracts**, which contributes to capturing essential semantic information and control flow dependencies. Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart contracts show that our proposed model and contract snippet representations significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. In addition, this work proves that it is practical to apply deep learning-based technology on smart contract vulnerability detection, which is able to promote future research towards this area.

The smart contracts deployed in Ethereum carry huge amounts of virtual coins. However, there are vulnerabilities in some of these smart contracts, which makes them vulnerable to malicious attacks. Due to the characteristics of blockchain, such vulnerable contracts are difficult to be revoked. In order to prevent vulnerable contracts, it is very important to detect the **loopholes** in these contracts before their deployment. In this paper, we focus on three vulnerabilities of smart contract: has_short_address, has_flows and is_greedy. For the three kinds of vulnerabilities, we propose **slicing matrix**, a new method to extract vulnerability feature, and construct three vulnerability detection models for comparison. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy based on neural network and slice matrix is better than that based on neural network and opcode features. In other words, slice matrix can improve the accuracy of vulnerable contract detection. Among our three detection models, the model based on random forest and opcode features performs best.

- Attention-based Machine Learning Model for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

Ethereum attracts extensive attention due to its distinctive function of smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). Since the number of contracts on blockchain has increased vigorously, various security vulnerabilities come up. Researchers rely on static symbolic analysis method at first, and it seems to perform well in the accuracy of vulnerability detection. However, this method **requires manual analysis in advance and it needs to traverse all the possible execution paths to find out the vulnerable ones. The deeper the path goes, the more time it costs to detect the contracts**(传统技术需要进一步的人工分析，还有路径爆炸的问题). This paper proposes an approach to detect smart contracts vulnerability on blockchain by using machine learning(ML) methods. This approach aims to build **a general benchmark** for new vulnerability detection in order to reduce the demand of expert manpower. Moreover, the high-speed-performance ML algorithm makes quick detection comes true. As long as we adjust the threshold of the model, it can work as a fast prefilter for the traditional symbolic analysis tools in further improvement of accuracy.
